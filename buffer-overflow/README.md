# Case Study- Glow Application Security Analysis

## Introduction

This document provides an analysis of the Glow application, including findings from examining the Glow.cpp source code and the executable file.

## Environment Setup

- **Operating System**: Windows XP (running in a virtual machine)
- **Tools Used**:
  - OllyDbg (Debugger)
  - PEiD (Executable Packer/Protector Detector)
  - UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables)
  - Hex Editors and other standard debugging tools

## Steps Followed

1. **Analyzing the Executable**:
   - Using PEiD, it was determined that Glow.exe was packed with UPX.

   - The executable was then unpacked using UPX: `upx -d "Glow.exe"`

2. **Loading and Debugging with OllyDbg**:
   - Glow.exe was loaded into OllyDbg for dynamic analysis. Breakpoints were set at critical functions, particularly those handling password input and verification.

## Conclusion

The analysis revealed that the Glow application has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `ReadPasswordHash` function. By inputting more than 20 characters, it was possible to overflow the buffer and cause the application to crash. This demonstrates the importance of proper input validation and secure coding practices.
