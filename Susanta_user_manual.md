## List of Vulnerabilities

PentestPal tests for the following vulnerabilities:
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**
- **Broken Authentication**
- **Broken Access Control**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

## Steps to Run the Application

1. Open a terminal on your project.
2. Navigate to the `gui` folder by executing:
   ```bash
   cd gui
   
 
3. Run the application with
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    
    
4. Then go to http://localhost:5000

## Vulnerabilities

## Sensitive Data Exposure

Definition: Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when sensitive information, such as personal data, passwords, or secret tokens, is not properly protected. This can lead to unauthorized access or data leaks.

## URL: http://localhost:5000/sde

## Vulnerable App: bWAPP (Bee-box Web Application)

Test Cases
1.  Base64 Encoding (Secret): Test by extracting a Base64 encoded secret from cookies, decoding it, and displaying it to demonstrate how sensitive data can be easily exposed if not properly secured.
2.  Text Files (Accounts): Attempt to store user credentials in plain text and check if these credentials are accessible or stored insecurely.

## Broken Authentication
Definition: Broken Authentication involves vulnerabilities that allow attackers to compromise user accounts, such as weak password policies, session fixation, or lack of brute-force protection.

## URL: http://localhost:5000/broken_auth

## Vulnerable App: bWAPP (Bee-box Web Application)

## Test Cases
1. Weak Passwords: Test by attempting to log in using a list of commonly weak passwords to see if they are accepted by the application.

2. Brute Force Protection Bypass: Simulate a brute-force attack by making repeated login attempts to determine if the application implements account lockout or other protections.

3  Session Fixation: Examine whether session IDs are predictable or reused after login, indicating potential session fixation vulnerabilities.


## Broken Access Control
Definition: Broken Access Control occurs when users are able to access resources or perform actions that they are not authorized to. This could involve users accessing other users' data or gaining higher-level privileges.

## URL: http://localhost:5000/broken_acc

## Vulnerable App: bWAPP (Bee-box Web Application)

Test Cases
1.  Horizontal Privilege Escalation:Test whether one user can modify or access another user's data by attempting to update another user's blog entry.
2.  Vertical Privilege Escalation: Attempt to perform actions reserved for higher-privileged users, such as deleting content or accessing administrative features, to determine if the application properly enforces role-based access control.

3.  change security level:  Attempt to change the security level of users like from low to high.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Definition: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages that are viewed by other users. These scripts can steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

## URL: http://localhost:5000/xss

## Vulnerable App: bWAPP (Bee-box Web Application)

Test Cases
1.  Reflected XSS: Test by injecting scripts into the application's URL or form fields to see if they are reflected back in the response and executed.
2.  Stored XSS: Attempt to inject scripts into a blog entry or comment field and check if the script is stored on the server and executed when other users view the page.
