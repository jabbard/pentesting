# Penetration Testing Tool Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a penetration testing tool designed to identify and assess vulnerabilities in a software system housed in a contained environment. Our focus is on leveraging open-source tools and frameworks, guided by the OWASP standards.


## What is a Vulnerability?

A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, or network that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or cause damage. Vulnerabilities can arise from various factors, including coding errors, configuration issues, or insufficient security controls. Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of information systems.
