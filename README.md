# Penetration Testing Tool Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a penetration testing tool designed to identify and assess vulnerabilities in a software system housed in a contained environment. Our focus is on leveraging open-source tools and frameworks, guided by the OWASP standards.

### Project Description

 **Build a Penetration testingLinks to an external site. tool**
  Identity a suitable software (in a contained environment) that holds some sensitive information. Build a tool to perform penetration tests on this software. The breakdown of activities will involve:
  - Identification of the vulnerable software.
  - Have a scoping exercise with the tool to understand connections, architecture, scope etc.
    - Output should be a scoping assessment document.
    - Presentation
  - Develop a penetration-testing plan to list planned test scenarios, expected outcomes for pass/fail, planned testing methodologies. This will need to refer to the OWASP framework and other common TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) for testing.
    - Output should be a penetrating testing plan.
    - Presentation
  - Identity suitable Open Source penetrating tools to perform penetrating testing.
    - Output should be a draft penetrating testing report.
    - Presentation & Demonstration.
  - Conduct meeting with tool owner to ensure factual accuracy of the findings.
  - Risk assess the findings based on a risk management framework and propose remediation.
    - Output should be the final penetrating testing report including final ratings and proposed remediation.
    - Presentation.

Final Deliverable: Build a tool to partially or fully perform penetration testing on a web software for common vulnerabilities.
