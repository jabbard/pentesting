# pentesting

My plans to do the pentesting.






1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)	

bWAPP (Buggy Web Application)

      Burp suite

        2.2	 Cross-site scripting (XSS) involves injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.


2. XML External Entity (XXE)

       Burpsuite

   V2.0	XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities allow attackers to interfere with the processing of XML data.

3. Broken Access control	

 OWASP Juice Shop

https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/	

       Dast

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/	


 13.0.2	An attacker could change the ID in the URL to http://example.com/user/456 to access another user's data.


4. Vulnerable and Outdated components	

 NodeGoat

https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat/releases	

   OWASP Dependency-Check

https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/
	

 1.3.0	Using components with known vulnerabilities can lead to exploitation of these weaknesses.
