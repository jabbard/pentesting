# Penetration Testing Tool Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a penetration testing tool designed to identify and assess vulnerabilities in a software system housed in a contained environment. Our focus is on leveraging open-source tools and frameworks, guided by the OWASP standards.

- **Goals for the week after**:
  - Finalize the research
  - Study about how pen-testing is done

### Week 3: Research
- **Activities**:
  - Set up the virtual machine, done with Windows XP but tried Kali Linux, RedHat Linux.
  - Finalised the research and jotted down the vulnerabilities that are most common in 2024.
  - Based on the vulnerabilities, gathered softwares that are most vulnerable to that vulnerability along with their    versions.
  - Found the names, Git Hub repos for the open source pen testing tools already existing for these vulnerabilities.
  - Started learning about Pen testing.

- **Goals for the week after**:
  - Set up linux environment in the virtual machine.
  - Study more about how pen-testing is done


### Week 4: Scoping and Extensive Research
- **Activities**:
  - Conducted a scoping exercise to understand the software architecture, connections, and scope.
  - Set up the environment - Kali Linux, Windows XP(Spent a lot of time on Ubuntu but then switched to Kali Linux).
  - Studied the material provided by the client and then more about Bwapp and bee-box. Set up the environment for that.
  - Studied about SQLMap and have that in Kali Linux OS.
  - Studied about Pen-testing from PentesterLab.
  - Researched and selected open-source penetration testing tools suitable for our needs.
  - Started initial tests using selected tools.
- **Goals for the week after**:
  - Master the Penetration Testing for SQL Injection(SQLMap)
