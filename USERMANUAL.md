## Description

PentestPal is designed to facilitate the penetration testing process by automating the detection of common vulnerabilities in web applications. It currently focuses on:

- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Command Injection (Commandi)
- Buffer Overflow

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Apache and MySQL (for DVWA)
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) for SQLi and Commandi testing
- Custom or user-provided executable for Buffer Overflow testing

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pentestpal.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the gui directory
    ```bash
    cd pentestpal/gui
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that Apache and MySQL services are running:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start apache2
    sudo systemctl start mysql
    ```
2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
4. Choose the vulnerability type (SQLi, Commandi, or Buffer Overflow) from the sidebar.

## SQL Injection (SQLi)

- URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/sqli
- Vulnerable Application: DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- After selecting SQLi, choose the security level (Low, Medium, High, Impossible) and the tool will display a report detailing which SQL payloads were successful.

## Command Injection (Commandi)

- URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/commandi
- Vulnerable Application: DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- Similar to SQLi, select the security level to view the results of the command injections performed by the tool.

## Buffer Overflow

- URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/buffer_overflow
- Vulnerable Application: Custom executable provided by the user
- Upload an executable file to test for buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The tool will analyze the file and present a report on any detected vulnerabilities.

## Setting Up DVWA

For SQLi and Commandi, you need to set up DVWA. Follow [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=ybmwuHsrx-RwPrwt&v=jJbMkqUezpI&feature=youtu.be) to install and configure DVWA.
