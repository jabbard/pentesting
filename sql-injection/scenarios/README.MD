# SQL Injection Test Scenarios

This document outlines the test scenarios for SQL Injection vulnerabilities using different techniques. The tests are designed to evaluate the system's ability to handle and mitigate SQL Injection attacks.

## Test Scenarios

## Test Scenarios

| Vulnerability          | Test Case Scenario             | Description                                                                                     | Expected Result                                                                                               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic SQL Injection**| Basic SQL Injection Test       | Attempt to inject a basic SQL command (`' OR '1'='1`) into login and search fields to bypass authentication or reveal sensitive data. | The system should not execute the injected SQL and should handle the input safely without leaking data.       |
| **Error-Based SQL Injection** | Error-Based SQL Injection Test | Input SQL commands that cause database errors to probe the structure of the database.             | The system should safely handle errors without exposing any database information.                              |
| **Time-Based SQL Injection**  | Time-Based SQL Injection Test | Input SQL commands that delay responses (e.g., using `WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'`) to infer database behavior. | No delay should be observable; the system should handle commands without timing discrepancies.                 |
| **Union-Based SQL Injection** | Union-Based SQL Injection Test | Use SQL UNION statements to attempt retrieval of data from other tables.                           | The system should block data retrieval attempts that are not part of the intended query structure.             |

## Techniques Used
![Techniques](techniques.png)
- **B**: Boolean-based blind
- **E**: Error-based
- **U**: Union query-based
- **S**: Stacked queries
- **T**: Time-based blind
- **Q**: Inline queries

## Execution

Each scenario is executed using a specific SQL injection technique to test the system's resilience and response to malicious inputs. The expected results indicate how the system should behave under each type of attack.
