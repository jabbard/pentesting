## Vulnerabilities

### SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

**Definition:** SSRF is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send requests from the server to internal or external resources, which can lead to information disclosure, server-side request manipulation, or even remote code execution.

**URL:** `http://localhost:8000/ssrf`

**Vulnerable App:** Self-created simple API parser

## Test Cases

1. **Sending HTML Request through Loopback IP:** Test by sending requests to different commonly used ports on `localhost` to see if there are any other applications running on the server.
2. **Fetching Content of Local Files:** Attempt to retrieve the content of various local files to check if the server can access sensitive files.
3. **Fetching Metadata of Common Cloud-Based Services:** Try to access metadata from cloud-based services (e.g., AWS, GCP) to see if the server is leaking any cloud service metadata.
