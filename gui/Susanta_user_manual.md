1.	Introduction

This application is designed for security professionals, developers, and IT administrators who want to understand and mitigate common web application vulnerabilities. This user manual provides detailed instructions on how to use the Flask-based application designed to test four critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities: Sensitive Data Exposure, Broken Authentication, Broken Access Control, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The tool leverages Python scripts to identify and demonstrate these vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
 The tool tests for:
•	Sensitive Data Exposure
•	Broken Authentication
•	Broken Access Control
•	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Each vulnerability is demonstrated using specific scenarios, and the results are displayed in a user-friendly web interface.

2.	Installation and Setup

Prerequisites:
•	Python 3.x
•	Flask
•	pip (Python package installer)
Installation Steps:
1.	Clone the Repository:
o	Clone the application repository from GitHub or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2.	Install Required Packages:
o	Navigate to the project directory and run:
3.	Run the Flask Application:
o	Start the Flask server by running:
o	The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

 

3.	Navigating the Application

Once the Flask server is running, navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser. The homepage will provide links to each vulnerability test.
Sensitive Data Exposure
•	Accessing the Test:
o	Click on the "Sensitive Data Exposure" link in the sidebar.
•	Description:
o	This test identifies insecure storage or transmission of sensitive data such as passwords or session tokens.

 

Broken Authentication
•	Accessing the Test:
o	Click on the "Broken Authentication" link in the sidebar.
•	Description:
o	This test checks for weak password policies, brute-force protection, and session fixation vulnerabilities.
 






Broken Access Control
•	Accessing the Test:
o	Click on the "Broken Access Control" link in the sidebar.
•	Description:
o	This test evaluates whether users can perform actions or access data they are not authorized to.

 







Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
•	Accessing the Test:
o	Click on the "XSS Testing" link in the sidebar.
•	Description:
o	This test checks for vulnerabilities where malicious scripts can be injected into web pages, compromising the security of users.


 

4.	Understanding the Results

Each test outputs detailed information about the vulnerability detected. Here’s what to look for in the results:
Sensitive Data Exposure
•	Base64 Encoding: If the tool identifies sensitive data stored in Base64 format, it will decode and display it.
•	Text Files (Accounts): The tool checks if user credentials are stored in plain text files and displays any findings.
Broken Authentication
•	Weak Passwords: The tool attempts to log in using common weak passwords and reports any successful attempts.
•	Brute Force Protection: The tool simulates a brute-force attack and checks if the account is locked after multiple failed attempts.
•	Session Fixation: The tool examines whether session IDs are predictable or reused, which could lead to session hijacking.
Broken Access Control
•	Horizontal Privilege Escalation: The tool tests whether one user can modify another user’s data.
•	Vertical Privilege Escalation: The tool checks if a regular user can perform actions reserved for administrators, such as deleting content.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
•	Reflected XSS: The tool tests if malicious scripts can be injected and reflected immediately in the web page response.
•	Stored XSS: The tool checks if scripts can be stored on the server and later executed when other users view the page.

5.	Mitigating Vulnerabilities
After identifying vulnerabilities, it’s crucial to implement the necessary fixes. Here are some recommendations:
•	Sensitive Data Exposure: Encrypt sensitive data, use secure transmission protocols (HTTPS), and avoid storing sensitive data in cookies.
•	Broken Authentication: Implement strong password policies, use multi-factor authentication, and enforce account lockout mechanisms.
•	Broken Access Control: Implement role-based access control (RBAC), and ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized for.
•	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Sanitize user inputs, encode output data, and implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

6.	Troubleshooting
•	Application Not Starting: Ensure all dependencies are installed and that Flask is properly configured.
•	Test Not Running: Check that the Python scripts are correctly placed in their respective directories and are executable.

7.	Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
•	Why is the login step not showing in the results?
o	The login process is automated and designed to be silent to keep the focus on the vulnerabilities being tested.
•	Can I add more tests?
o	Yes, the tool is extensible. You can add new Python scripts for additional tests and update the Flask routes accordingly.
